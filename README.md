## Description (about 100 words)

In making the game, we hope to provide a solid way to spend some time while relaxing and getting immersed through the imagination in a text-based adventure. The app hopes to solve boredom and provide entertainment. The game will be able to be run in a simple terminal window, allowing for a consistent experience between gameplay. You get to take on the role of a mighty adventurer, traversing through a dungeon while fighting monsters all packaged within a terminal window. The game makes use of ASCII art to give the user a fun visual feedback that helps the overall enjoyment of the game.
